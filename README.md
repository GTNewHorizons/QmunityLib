## Bug reports
When issuing a bug report. Please take a look first here: https://github.com/Qmunity/QmunityLib/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed. It might very well be that somebody already filed the bug you have, and we've already fixed it.

If nobody else reported the same bug, you can go ahead and report it. Please make sure to include the following info:
- **What where you doing when you had the issue?**
- **What did you expect to happen?**
- **What happened instead?**
- **Crashlog**

Please supply a crashlog using pastebin! do *not* paste a crashlog directly in the issue!
Also please try to reproduce your crash. It's possible that a crash only happened because of a quirk in the universe.

The project is in active development and may not always be stable!
